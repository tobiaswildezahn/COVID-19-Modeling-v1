The estimated number of currently infected individuals is **{total_infections:.0f}**.
The **{initial_infections}** confirmed cases in the region imply a **{detection_prob_str}** rate of detection. This is based on current inputs for Hospitalizations (**{current_hosp}**), Hospitalization rate (**{hosp_rate:.0%}**), Region size (**{S}**), and Hospital market share (**{market_share:.0%}**).

An initial doubling time of **{doubling_time}** days and a recovery time of **{recovery_days}** days imply an $R_0$ of **{r_naught:.2f}**.

**Mitigation**: A **{relative_contact_rate:.0%}** reduction in social contact after the onset of the
outbreak reduces the doubling time to **{doubling_time_t:.1f}** days, implying an effective $R_t$ of **${r_t:.2f}$**.
